Predicting County Presidential Winners

We have included a data file for training named train_potus_by_county.csv which includes some metadata about a county
and who won in that county's election. You job is to create a model that correctly predicts who won in that county.

1) build_model script: should read train_potus_by_county.csv and then build, train and tune your best predictive model.
The script should save your best model to the filesystem and it should also log data about the expected performance of
the model to a text file performance.txt

2) make_predictions script: should load your saved model generated by the first script, read the file test_potus_by_county.csv
and output a predictions.csv file with your predictions (one prediction per line)

3) predictions.csv: one prediction per line that is in the same order as test_potus_by_county.csv. There should be a header
now that says Winner and each line should contain the appropriate prediction of the name of the candiate. We have included a
simple validation script validate.py to make sure your prediction file is in the correct format.

Example predictions.csv format:

Winner
Barack Obama
Barack Obama
Mitt Romney
Barack Obama
Mitt Romney
Barack Obama
....
Mitt Romney


4) model binary: serialized version of your best model from running step 1

5) performance.txt: the data about the expected performance of your model, how you evaluated the best model

6) notes.txt: should include the software dependencies for your code, optionally any notes about how you chose your model, 
how you engineered your features, what other options you wanted to explore but didn't have time.

Feel free to use whatever standard machine learning packages you'd like.

- the performance of the model,
- the quality/clarity of the code
- the methodology of the best feature/model selection.

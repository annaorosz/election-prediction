Dependencies & decisions about my model

Software Dependencies:
Keras
Tensorflow
Python 3

Why I chose to use these softwares and model:

In Keras, a neural network model can be implemented efficiently and can be used with multiple different backends:
Tensorflow, Theano, etc which all have neural network modules.

I chose to use a Sequential neural network model which has a stack of layers, because I believe that this gives a
sophisticated, yet not too complicated model to predict the presidential winners.

This model is proficient because it can give better classification by using non-linear boundaries and it is easy
to prevent overfitting (contrary to a decision tree, for example).
There were only 2 possible outputs, so a more complicated neural network was not necessary in this case.
By making adjustments to the model, such as BathNormalization, Dropouts, shuffling the data, etc.,
the performance was further improved.

With a neural network, it is much easier to adjust some settings (compared to other ML models),
most importantly, normalizing the data of features and accounting for skewed data.
